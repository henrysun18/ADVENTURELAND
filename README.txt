NOTE: To limit the amount of tries the player can use, I implemented the LIVES system - player has 3 lives (2 reserve lives)
NOTE: I used random 5-letter words in the King of K(ompar)ing minigame.
NOTE: THERE ARE THREE ENDINGS (one for death, one for win, one for first place)




If you see the following error message:
Exception in threat "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: (##)
	at java.lang.String.substring(String.java:####)
	at ADVENTURELAND.main(ADVENTURELAND.java:##)
Copy-paste the following set of 40 underlines into highscores.txt to fix the problem.
